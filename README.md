Nyanyumba Womenâ€™s Cooperative is a proactive women's cooperative that 
produces top-notch specialty coffee. They have unique coffee and they have 
customers all over the world. In recent years, they have seen their sales 
going high. However, they have a challenge to connect with customers or 
their products to be seen by customers.  There is a third-party organization 
that is helping with that. Their goal for 2024 is to be digital and connect and 
interact with their customers. They want their products to be seen and 
viewed online. In Order to bring solutions for them we have designed  a website which will help them to connect with their potential customers worldwide.
